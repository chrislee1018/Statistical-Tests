# Statistical Tests

Statistical tests implemented in T-SQL with sample data.

In the implementations provided, the statistical tests are provided as temporary stored procedures.  This is intended to allow users to try the tests without requiring write permissions on the database that they are using.

Sample data is also included with each test which allows a straightforward, practical demonstration of how the scripts work in practice.

### Prerequisites

SQL Server

SQL Server Management Studio

### Installing

Both scripts have been written using temporary tables and temporary stored procedures and so it is not required to install anything in order for the scripts to run successfully.
